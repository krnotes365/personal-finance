It has been few months since I posted on this group. so much has happened in the world this year. As someone who has now done 20yrs in stock market, 2022 has hit me like a train. Markets have a way to make us humble and to be honest I am glad 2022 happened! 

So here are few things I wanted to share: 

### 1. Personal finance 
First thing off the bat. Get a plain vanilla term plan. Get 9-12 month of emergency fund in an FD. Buy low cost index fund. Cover medical insurance. Max out PPF. 

This is 90% of personal finance a normal person needs. More details below

### 2. Emergency fund is meant for emergency and not for returns
Don’t buy debt fund with your emergency fund. Simple. Tradable Debt instruments are risky. If anyone has told you otherwise, you have been lied. I don’t want to get into the list of risks, but there are more than 10 of them and each risk has potential to screw you badly. From liquidity risk to interest rate risk to credit risk to plain fraud. 

FD isn’t tax friendly but trust me 9-12 month of emergency fund won’t give enough returns from an FD to matter tax wise. 

### 3. Marry right 
I can’t stress this enough. Marriage is the single most important thing you will do in your life. Don’t fall into a trap. Everyone ages and they aren’t the best looking at 35/40/45/50/55/60! 

### 4. Understand Cash flow
A lot of people are stuck by net worth and income. While it is great to have a high net worth and great salary, always always calculate your cash flow. 

There is no point owning 5 houses that you can not sell or get rental income while being valued at 10crs. 

There is no point having a great salary when you have debt at 30%

### 5. Credit card is a miracle and a curse 
Use credit cards when you don’t need a credit card. Credit card gives 45 days of free unsecured lending. There is no product in the world like a credit card. 

It charges 36% the day you miss a payment. There are very few regulated products that charges this rate. 

Use the credit card to gets cash back and manage cash flows. Never ever miss a payment. 

### 6. Excel / Google Spread Sheet 
I know apps are great to get a hold of your investments. But you can go from being super fit to hospital bed in matter of hours. The iPhone may not recognize your face or you may not be able to explain the finances to your spouse. 

A Excel/Google spread sheet with all the details with access to you and your beneficiaries can be a huge difference to life. 

Get your finances on a shared spread sheet 

### 7. Focus on income and not on expenses. No one likes a kanjoos, don’t be the kanjoos of your gang
There is post on this group about how people save money. It is the most sorry comment section ever. Like ever! 

Focus to increase your income. Get a side hustle. Go for on-site. Get a job in GCC for few years. Switch jobs. Work to get that promotion. 

Don’t worry about spending few thousands here and there. It doesn’t matter to be honest. We are all here for a short time. Live in a good society. Eat well. Dress well. Groom your facial hair well. Go on vacations. 

### 8. You will have financial setbacks. Try to get them early in life 
I once lost 77% of my portfolio cause was I was deep on leverage and I was playing the casino game on stocks. It went from plus 250% to negative 77% in matter of months (Jan 2008 to Sep 2008). Thankfully my portfolio was relatively small. I went into depression because I had lost my dad’s pay commission money and he wasn’t even aware of it. He had trusted me with his money and it was all gone along with my MBA fees. 

I ended up taking loan for my MBA and saying sorry to my dad for almost a decade. I did repay the money within a year but the guilt still exist. 

Don’t leverage unless you know your worst case scenario. 

### 9. If you are in India, you are at the right place at the right time 
The world has gone to shit. I am not exaggerating. I live in canada and the financial world has just melted in western hemisphere. The western economies are in stagflation. US markets are below 200DMA with inverted yield curve and expected rate hike while inflation refuses to go away. 

India is at ATH. There is growth expected of 6.8%. Inflation hasn’t been bad wrt peers. Currency has held up. Russian oil has helped. 

The big money is just waiting to pour in. Don’t miss the bus. 

### 10. Mulitbaggers 
You might wonder if there are multibaggers left in india. The answer is simple - Yes. They are right in front of you. 

I picked Page Industries early cause I spoke to a shopkeeper on why he is keeping Jockey products in the front aisle while rest are in back aisles. 

Speak to your shopkeepers on what people are buying. Look at the carts of other shoppers of what they are buying. If you do this often, you will be able to pick the product that is sticking with consumers. Then go in-depth of that product. Who is making the packaging. who is the supplier. Where the label is printed. Who is transporting it. If you do little bit of leg work, you will make crores. 

### 11. Get to your 50 Lac portfolio 
10% return on 1Lac is 10K. On 10Lac it is 1Lac. on 50Lacs it is 5Lac. Get your portfolio to cross a threshold to actually see major gains in real money terms. 

You don’t spend money in percentages. You spend it in real ruppees and you can make real money only when you put enough money to work. 

### 12. PPF/EPF 
Every building needs a solid foundation. PPF/EPF are EEE on taxation. It is sovereign backed. Again, there is no such product in the world. Max it out. 

The race of personal finance is a long one. A stable portion of portfolio will make your life easy. 

### 13. If an investment makes you lose your sleep, skip it 
Money is there to buy you happiness and freedom, not stress. If something makes you uneasy, skip it. 

Trust me. I got blood pressure when I was 26. I was once admitted to the hospital with 60% mortality chances. The stress from work and the greed to make money was
partially behind it. It isn’t worth it. 

I can trade options half awake (mostly because I can read charts very well - at least I think so) and there are people in this group who know my strike rate with options. Yet I don’t trade them more than twice or thrice a year. I am majorly into index fund now. 

Once you reach a decent number invested, move to safer investments and let compounding do its work. 

### 14. Get a good CA
A stitch in time saves nine

### 15. Crypto is a scam
There isn’t an asset class I have not traded (this includes crypto). If the value of an asset is based completely on how much it can be pumped via influencers, that asset is pretty much a scam. 

It is unregulated. Miners are in god for shaken places. Wallets aren’t safe. SBF types players are everywhere. And ffs AIB comedians were into it. 

Again. I am not saying blockchain as a tech is scam. I am saying crypto as an alternative to sovereign backed currency or as storage of value is a scam. Don’t tell me to zoom out to see the return from 5yrs or 7yrs. The whole thing is a house of cards. 

Plus it is bad for environment 

### 16. Politics 
I know it is a no go area in this group. But let me touch it. 

You might be all cool making 1Cr a year with 5Cr in index fund. But if you arent aware of how politics of the country is playing out, you are at risk. 

Govt have immense power. You must learn to see how that power will impact you. Always follow politics closely and vote wisely. 

Chalo enough for the day!
