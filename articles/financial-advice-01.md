# Financial Advice - 01

1. Life insurance, health insurance, maxing out PPF, avoiding credit card debt delays, investing excess in a low cost index fund is 90% of personal finance management. 

   Plain vanilla term plan, proper health coverage on health insurance, being serious with PPF, SIP in index fund and auto payment to credit card. That’s it! 

2. Stock picking is extremely tough. Don’t attempt it

   Yes you know someone who bought Bajaj Fin at 80 and HDFC at 25. Did you really see the statement to cross check this? 
   
   Almost 80-90% active mutual fund fail to match index fund returns. These are professionally run fund with an army of analysts and access to mgmt and yet they fail to beat the index. 
   
   Fact- You aren’t that bright. At least 99% of the people with non-finance background doesn’t have time and acumen to pick stocks. 
   
3. If you are 6 and a girl who is 9 approaches you for a date, it’s a trap.

   If fixed deposit is at 6%, index fund returns is at 10% and someone comes with a coin or NFT or scheme or DeFi with 12-14% return, it is a trap. 
   
   Don’t fall for a well laid trap. Smooth talkers are usually expensive at the end.
   
4. Multibaggers

   It is rare for a mid cap stock to become a large cap. And it is extremely rare for a small cap to turn into a large cap in one generation. You will not find a multibagger without willing to lose 100% on 9 out of 10 bets (this is the best of the odds). So take you chances knowing you will lose 100% of capital 
   
5. Leverage is your best friend. Leverage is your worst enemy

   Amount of debt doesn’t matter. Cash flow matters. If you can service debt with cash flow, debt and leverage can be your friend, if your cash flow is dicey, don’t even think of debt
   
6. Bonds are riskier than stocks.

   Long story short, bond do default and unlike stocks they are more illiquid 

7. Experience trumps knowledge

    I am in my 19th year of trading. I once lost 77% of my portfolio. I have a professional degree in finance and I have worked in banking for 12yrs. Yet I feel a broker sitting in Surat has better odds than me to make money in short term and I have better odds than him in long term.
