# Financial Advice - 01

### 1. Life insurance, health insurance, maxing out PPF, avoiding credit card debt delays, investing excess in a low cost index fund is 90% of personal finance management. 
Plain vanilla term plan, proper health coverage on health insurance, being serious with PPF, SIP in index fund and auto payment to credit card. That’s it! 

### 2. Stock picking is extremely tough. Don’t attempt it
Yes you know someone who bought Bajaj Fin at 80 and HDFC at 25. Did you really see the statement to cross check this? 
   
Almost 80-90% active mutual fund fail to match index fund returns. These are professionally run fund with an army of analysts and access to mgmt and yet they fail to beat the index. 
   
Fact- You aren’t that bright. At least 99% of the people with non-finance background doesn’t have time and acumen to pick stocks. 
   
### 3. If you are 6 and a girl who is 9 approaches you for a date, it’s a trap.
If fixed deposit is at 6%, index fund returns is at 10% and someone comes with a coin or NFT or scheme or DeFi with 12-14% return, it is a trap. 
   
Don’t fall for a well laid trap. Smooth talkers are usually expensive at the end.
   
### 4. Multibaggers
It is rare for a mid cap stock to become a large cap. And it is extremely rare for a small cap to turn into a large cap in one generation. You will not find a multibagger without willing to lose 100% on 9 out of 10 bets (this is the best of the odds). So take you chances knowing you will lose 100% of capital 
   
### 5. Leverage is your best friend. Leverage is your worst enemy
Amount of debt doesn’t matter. Cash flow matters. If you can service debt with cash flow, debt and leverage can be your friend.  If your cash flow is dicey, don’t even think of debt
   
### 6. Bonds are riskier than stocks.
Long story short, bond do default and unlike stocks they are more illiquid 

### 7. Experience trumps knowledge
I am in my 19th year of trading. I once lost 77% of my portfolio. I have a professional degree in finance and I have worked in banking for 12yrs. Yet I feel a broker sitting in Surat has better odds than me to make money in short term and I have better odds than him in long term. 

### 8. Don’t track portfolio of financial professionals
Don’t look for the personal portfolio of people who are related to financial world. We have our hand tied on what we can buy, when we can buy, when we can sell and how much we can sell. Our portfolio is less about maximizing returns and more about not going to jail due to conflict of interest/insider trading
   
### 9. People hide losses and exaggerate gains
I have held stocks that gave 10x returns over a long term. I share such names with my friends. I very rarely share that I bought Suzon at 390 and Jai Corp at 1000+ 
  
You are living your journey. Don’t try to replicate someone else journey. 
   
### 10. Recessions aren’t the best time to make a portfolio for long term
A lot of newbies wish for recession so that they can buy funds/stocks at cheaper price. However chances of you going all-in during a time of gloom is very low. That is how human mind works.
   
Be realistic in life and don’t go by quotes including this one
   
### 11. Dividends matter
A company that is growing and pays dividend matters. That is where most of the wealth is made coz the dividend ensure you never have to sell the stock to meet your expenses.

### 12. Further dividend means the company is making cash flow. 
Infy is a multi bagger. So is TCS. Both have 4-5x’ed in last 12yrs.

Large caps can be multibaggers plus their dividends keeps increasing 
   
### 13. Spend money on things that matter
There is a thread by the prof on this group on how to save money. Very interesting comments - repeat clothes to work, switch off engine at downslope, hair cut every 3 months.
   
No one like a miser, don’t be one.
   
### 14. Marry right 
Marriage is the biggest financial decision of your life. A wrong match can set you back by decades.
   
### 15. Show up well dressed
This world is very shallow - a well groomed hair cut, crisp formals and good shoes will go a long way.
   
If you are in tech or start up, remember neither Steve jobs, nor gates nor zuck ever appeared wearing shorts and unironed shirt. You are just an engineer who is wearing a dirty shorts and your facial hair probably has dried up beer, pls get a life!
