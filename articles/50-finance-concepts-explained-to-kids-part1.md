| 1   | Business     | Let’s imagine you are selling lemonade.    | Your lemon stand is your business because you sell lemonade there. |
| 2   | Money        | This is what people give you when they buy your lemonade.  | When your friends buy lemonade from your stand, they give you money. |
| 3   | Cost         | This is what you pay for lemons & sugar to make lemonade.  | If you buy a lemon for $1 and sugar for $1, your cost is $2.  |
| 4   | Profit       | This is the money left after you pay all your costs.  | If you sell lemonade for $5 & it costs $2 to make, your profit is $3. |
| 6   | Investing    | This is using your saved money to make your lemon stand better.  | If you use your saved $2 to buy a new sign, you are investing. |
| 7   | Price        | This is how much people have to give you to get one lemonade.  | If each cup of lemonade is $1, that’s the price. |
| 8   | Customer     | These are the friends who come to buy your lemonade.  | When your friend buys a lemonade from you, they are a customer. |
| 9   | Supply and demand  | If many friends want your lemonade but you have only a little, you might ask for more money.  | If you only have 10 lemonades and 20 friends want one, you might ask for $2 instead of $1. |
| 10  | Advertisement| This is telling people about your lemon stand so they come to buy your lemonade.  | If you make a sign that says “Best Lemonade Here!” to show to people, that’s an advertisement. |
| 11  | Asset        | This is something valuable you own. | Your lemon stand & the lemons are your assets.  |
| 12  | Liability    | This is something you owe. | If you borrowed $5 to buy lemons, that $5 is a liability. |
| 13  | Depreciation | This is when something you own loses value over time.  | If your lemon stand is getting old and worn, it’s depreciating. |
| 14  | Capital Gain | This is the profit you make if you sell something for more than you bought it.  | If you sell your lemon stand for more money than you spent to make it, that’s a capital gain. |
| 15  | Dividend     | This is money shared with people who own part of a business.  | If your lemon stand makes a $10 profit, and you give $5 to your friend who owns part of it, that’s a dividend. |
| 16  | Economics    | This is the study of how people use resources and make and spend money.  | Learning about how many lemons people want to buy is studying economics |
| 17  | Risk         | This is the chance of losing something.  | If you think it might rain and nobody will buy lemonade, that’s a risk. |
| 18  | Leverage     | This is using borrowed money to make more money.  | If you borrow $10 to buy more lemons & make more lemonade to sell, you are using leverage |
| 19  | Opportunity Cost  | This is the value of what you give up when you make a choice.  | If you choose to sell lemonade instead of playing, the fun you miss is the opportunity cost.  |
| 20  | Demand       | This is how much people want something.  | If many people want your lemonade, the demand is high. |
| 21  | Supply       | This is how much of something is available. | If you have 100 cups of lemonade, that’s your supply. |
| 22  | Market Price | This is the amount of money people are willing to pay for something.  | If people will pay $1 for a cup of lemonade, that’s the market price. |
| 23  | Break-even Point  |  This is when your income equals your costs. |  If you spend $10 on lemons and sugar and earn $10 from selling lemonade, you break even. |
| 24  | Credit Score | This is a number that shows how well someone pays back borrowed money.  | If you always pay back money you borrow for lemons, you have a good credit score. |
| 25  | Tax          | This is money that you have to pay to the government.  | If you earn $10 from lemonade, you might have to give $1 as tax. |
